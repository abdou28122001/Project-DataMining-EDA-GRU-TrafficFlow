Dear Professor,
I hope you're doing well. I take the liberty of sending you our project entitled "Exploratory Data Analysis Techniques for Traffic Flow Prediction: Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate Approaches" that we carried out as part of the data mining module.
For easy access to our work, please find below the ZIP file containing all the necessary elements:
[ZIP file]

After downloading the ZIP file, please follow the steps below for the proper functioning of our project:

1- Download the ZIP file and extract its contents to the desktop.
2- to better understand use the "traffic-prediction-gru.ipynb" code in jupyter notebook and similarly if you can work with the Pycharm editor you can run the "Traffic Prediction GRU.py" file.
3- Test the code.
4- If you wish to consult the complete dataset used for the creation of the models, it is also available in this "traffic.csv" folder.

We hope this project will be useful for you to better understand the features we have implemented.
We thank you very much for your attention to our work and for the time you will devote to reviewing it.
Cordially.
